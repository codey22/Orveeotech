      <h2>From Zero to Real Work — The ORVEEOTECH Experience</h2>
      <p>The tech industry doesn’t reward certificates alone; it rewards <strong>proven experience</strong>. Our Beginner Friendly Project Based Training is designed to transform beginners into industry-ready contributors. Most programs stop at basic learning; we take you into real execution through structured simulations that mirror professional workflows.</p>

      <p>You won’t just “learn how it works” — you’ll <strong>work like it works in the real world</strong>. We prepare beginners to confidently step into professional environments through controlled, production-style simulations.</p>

      <h3>How It Works:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Beginner-Friendly Project Based Learning:</strong> Learn by building real, structured projects from the very start. The program is designed to take complete beginners through hands-on project work, gradually increasing complexity while strengthening fundamentals, problem-solving skills, and professional coding practices within an industry-style simulation environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Production-Style Workflow:</strong> Experience sprint planning, task ownership, reviews, and delivery cycles just like in a real tech company. Learn how to use Git, GitHub, and modern development workflows effectively in a team setup.</li>
        <li><strong>Role-Based Collaboration:</strong> Collaborate in structured teams with defined roles such as Team Leads, Frontend Developers, and Backend Engineers. Build simulation of real workplace communication, ownership, and accountability.</li>
        <li><strong>Deadlines & Quality Pressure:</strong> Learn to manage time, fix critical issues, and deliver quality work under deadlines — preparing you for real job expectations and professional environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Paid Internship On Industry Grade Simulation Projects For All Students:</strong> Every enrolled student transitions into a Paid Internship on industry grade simulation projects, where they contribute to production-style modules, follow professional workflows, and gain real work exposure in a simulated industry environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance-Based Stipend:</strong> Internship stipends are provided to all students and are structured based on individual performance and contribution.</li>
        <li><strong>Placement Assistance (Coming Soon):</strong> We are currently in the process of developing a dedicated placement assistance program to support our students in their career journeys. This will be offered in the near future.</li>
        <li><strong>Verified Career Credentials:</strong> On successful completion, students receive an Official Training & Internship Completion Certificate.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This isn’t just training. It’s a professional launchpad designed to take beginners to real-world readiness.</p>
      <p>Our learners don’t just “get trained” — they start performing like real contributors in a professional environment.</p>
