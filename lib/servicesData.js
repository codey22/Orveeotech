      <h2>Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Industry</h2>
      <p>The tech industry doesn't just need coders; it needs problem solvers. Our Project Simulation program is a unique offering that immerses aspiring developers in a simulated corporate environment. Most bootcamps teach syntax; we teach engineering. We bridge the critical gap between academic theory and the messy, complex reality of professional software development.</p>

      <h3>How It Works:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Real Client Scenarios:</strong> You don't build "To-Do" apps here. You work on complex modules derived from actual industry projects. You'll deal with vague requirements, changing scopes, and the need for scalable architecture.</li>
        <li><strong>Agile Workflow:</strong> Experience daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and code reviews just like in a top-tier tech company. You'll learn how to use Jira, Git, and CI/CD pipelines effectively in a team setting.</li>
        <li><strong>Role-Based Collaboration:</strong> Work in teams with designated Team Leads, Frontend Developers, and Backend Engineers. Learn the soft skills of communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution that are just as important as coding.</li>
        <li><strong>Pressure & Deadlines:</strong> Learn to manage time and deliver quality code under tight deadlines, preparing you for the reality of the job market. We simulate crunch times and critical bug fixes to build your resilience.</li>
        <li><strong>Placement Assistance:</strong> We will also provide placement assistance to the students, helping them transition smoothly from training to full-time employment through career guidance and industry connections.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This isn't a bootcamp. It's a career accelerator designed to make you 'Day 1 Ready' for any development role. Our graduates don't just get jobs; they hit the ground running and start contributing immediately.</p>
